## Project Architecture

This extension is primarily consist of a Popup (browserAction Popup) and Activity Log page (Extension page). The popup helps to "start monitor" or "stop monitor" all extensions and access the activity log page. On the other hand, the Activity Log page helps to view the logs detail, filtering logs, save the logs and load logs from a file.

The Activity Log page is using the MVC architecture and [web components](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib/web-component) for table view and filtering options. ES6 classes/modules are being used to encapsulate the different functionalities of the extension. Unit test is done with [JEST Framework](https://jestjs.io/) in this project.

### Data Flow

The extension recevies logs in the form of `object` from activityLog API. The activityLog API schema can been found [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/activity_log.json). It has only one event called [`onExtensionActivity`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/activity_log.json#20), which gets triggered everytime an activity is found from any monitored extensions and return a [log object](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/extensions/schemas/activity_log.json#24-76). We store these log objects inside the [`logs` array in background](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/ext-monitor.js#L7). We also stored the monitored extension in a [`Map` in Background](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/ext-monitor.js#L9). When we open the Activity Log page from popup, the page is being rendered with existing logs collected in the background and receives the future logs in real-time via [`runtime.onMessage` event](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/ext-activitylog.js#L235-L247) while it is opened. In Activity Log page, the logs are being rendered in table view with the help of [`log-view` web component](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/src/lib/web-component/log-view/log-view-element.js).

### Project Directory Structure

- [_`src`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src) - Inside _src_ the extension's code can be found (manifest.json, background.js etc.)
  - [_`activitylog`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/activitylog) - Contains activity log page (extension page).
  - [_`devtools`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/devtools) - Contains devtools panel.
  - [_`popup`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/popup) - Contains popup (browserAction popup).
  - [_`icons`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/icons) - Contains icons used in the extension.
  - [_`lib`_](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/tree/master/src/lib) - Contains most of the project's code. Here is a brief description of each of the files:
    - `ext-monitor.js` - It runs in the background.
    - `ext-listen.js` - It contains some instructions to communicate with the background.
    - `ext-popup.js` - It runs in the popup.
    - `ext-activitylog.js` - It runs in the Activity Log page.

## Pick an issue

If you are a new contributor looking for a easy bug/issue to get started, take a look at the list of [good first bugs](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+bug"). Feel free to ask permission from maintainers by commenting on any issue that you would like to work on.

## Installation

To install Extension Activity Monitor, follow the given instructions [here](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/README.md#installation).

## Run Test

To run all the test suits once, run the following command:

```
$ npm test
```

To run a single test suit once, run the following command:

```
$ npm test ext-monitor.test.js
```

Here, `ext-monitor.test.js` is the name of the test suit.

To run all the test suits continously, run the following command:

```
$ npm test:watch
```

To get the coverage report of all the test suits, run the following command:

```
$ npm test:coverage
```

## Check for Linter

This project is using ESLint as linter.
To make sure your code is compatible with our lint check, run the following command:

```
$ npm run lint:check
```

To make ESLint try to fix the lint errors automatically, run the following command:

```
$ npm run lint:fix
```

## Check for Prettier

This project is using Prettier as code formatter.
To make sure your code is formatted correctly, run the following code:

```
$ npm run prettier:check
```

To make Prettier try to fix the code formatting errors automatically, run the following command:

```
$ npm run prettier:fix
```

**NOTE**: Both ESLint and Prettier ignores the path mentioned in [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/blob/master/.gitignore) file.

## Submit a Bug or Issue or Feature Request

If you find a bug/issue in the codes or want to request a feature, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/mozilla/extension-activity-monitor/issues/new) to our GitHub Repository. Feel free ask for permission from the maintainers of the repository if you want to work on the filed issue.

## Create a Pull Request

When you create a pull request for an issue or new feature, be sure to mention the issue number for what you're working on. The best way to do it is to mention the issue like this at the top of the PR's description:
